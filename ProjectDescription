AquaWatch
we are  required to do the following 
1) recive three signal -B1(soil humidity sensor)	|
		       -B2(soil humidity sensor)	|  -------> this sensor tells us 
							            if the soil is dry or
							            or humid
		       -A0(water level sensor)		| --------> this sensor measures
								    the level of the fallen 
								    rain
2)the system well control two valve in the following
  order
		Rainfall Level	Soil Humidity Sensor	B1 Valve	B2 Valve
		>= 20mm		Any			Closed	        Closed
		Any		>= 60%			Closed		Closed
		Any		< 40%			Closed		Open
		< 20mm		< 40%			Open		Open


3)display the signal that we recived form the
  sensor on the LED Barograph 

4)we should have a switch to turn on/off the system

**the sensors:
	1-soil humidity sensor 
	  it takes two input Vcc and GND 
	  and gives one analogue output 
		A0----- 0 --> completely dry		 |
			5V -> maximum moisture level     |  ---> any value in between means the percentage
	2-water level sensor:
	 like the soil humidity sensor but 
	 the output well be the level of the 
	 rain water between(0-50mm)
	3-LED barograph 
	  it has 10 LEDs each one represent 
	  (5mm) of water
**sence we have alnaloge signal 
  we should read them in order 
  and sample them with a frequence 
  (1/3 Hz) the reading should be in
  this order 1-water level
	     2-B1 soil humidity
	     2-B2 soil humidity
